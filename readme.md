> WebExtension (for Firefox/Chrome/Opera/Edge) that prevents you from being tracked by Facebook/Twitterwhen you browse the web.


## Motivation

Social networks are great when they deal with their primary objective: being social ("`sharing is caring`", right?). But yet, these networks also manage to be monsters when they deal with gathering lots of data about you and your browsing.

Like many other websites, the main social networks may/will gather some information about you when you use them. Obviously, when you browse your wall on Facebook or when you see your tweet list on Twitter, the corresponding social network may know what you browsed on its pages. This is not just common to social networks: most mainstream news/entertainment/whatever-related websites will probably do the same, and each site might have provided you with some terms and conditions that cover what that website decides to analyse about your browsing. This extension is not about changing any of that.

Yet, thanks to the "Share" buttons that are heavily present on the web, social networks can also track what you do on the websites you visit, provided the websites you browse have such social buttons. When a page you browse has, for example, a "Share on Facebook" button, then the button can gather some data about your browsing on that page and send it directly to Facebook! This is the kind of tracking this extension is all about: stop the social networks from tracking you when you you're not even browsing them.

This browser extension makes it best of both worlds: prevent social networks from tracking your activity on the web, but still let you see your wall, your tweets when you browse the social networks directly. Social networks won't be able to track you unless you browse their own pages; on the rest of the web, you'll be free from their tracking.

This extension currently prevents you from being tracked by:

* Facebook
* Twitter
